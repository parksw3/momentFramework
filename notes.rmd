## Definition

We want to write $Y_o(v;D)$ for T**y**pe, **o**rder, **v**ariable, and **D**omain.

We define total as follows: $T_o(v;D) = \int v(a)^o D(a) da$. Since we're mainly interested with susceptibility for now, $T_o$ is represents $T_o(.;S)$.

We define $M_i = T_i/T_0$. Then, $M_1$ is the mean susceptibility and $\kappa = \frac{M_2M_0}{M_1^2}-1$ is the squared coefficient of variance (CV).

## SI example

We have $\dot{S}(a) = - \Lambda \sigma(a) S(a)$. Integrating gives us $\dot{T}_0 = - \Lambda T_1$. More generally, we have $\dot{T}_i = - \Lambda T_{i+1}$. Given that $M_1$ is the mean susceptibility, we can also write:

$$
\dot{S} = - \Lambda M_1 S
$$

Using $M$ defined above, we also have the following equations: $\dot{M}_i = - \Lambda (M_{i+1} - M_i M_1)$.

Given that $M_2 = (1 + \kappa) M^2$ and assuming that $\kappa$ stays constant, we can integrate the equation above to obtain the following equation:

$M = \hat{M}S^\kappa$, where $\hat{M}$ is the mean susceptibility of the susceptible population at a disease free equilibrium.

We can define $\kappa = \kappa_2$ and extend this idea to $\kappa_i = \frac{M_iM_{i-2}}{M_{i-1}^2}-1$. We can derive an equation for $\kappa_i$ as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\kappa_i} &= \frac{M_{i-2}M_{i-1}\dot{M}_i + M_{i-1}M_i \dot{M}_{i-2} - 2 M_{i-2} M_i \dot{M}_{i-1} }{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&= -\Lambda \frac{M_{i-2}M_{i-1}(M_{i+1} - M_i M_1) + M_{i-1}M_i (M_{i-1} - M_{i-2}M_1) - 2 M_{i-2} M_i (M_i - M_{i-1}M_1) }{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&= -\Lambda \frac{M_{i-2}M_{i-1}M_{i+1} + M_{i-1}^2M_i - 2 M_{i-2}M_i^2}{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&= -\Lambda \frac{M_{i-2} (\kappa_{i+1} + 1)M_i^2 + M_{i-1}^2M_i - 2 M_{i-2}M_i^2}{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&= -\Lambda \frac{(\kappa_{i+1} - 1)M_{i-2} M_i^2 + M_{i-1}^2M_i}{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&=-\Lambda \frac{(\kappa_{i+1} - 1)(\kappa_i +1)M_iM_{i-1}^2 + M_{i-1}^2M_i}{M_{i-1}^3}\\
&=-\Lambda \frac{(\kappa_{i+1}\kappa_i - \kappa_i + \kappa_{i+1})M_i}{M_{i-1}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

If we assume that $\kappa_i$ stays constant, we can find the higher order $\kappa$ using the following equation:

$$
\kappa_{i+1} = \frac{\kappa_i}{\kappa_i + 1}
$$

Another idea is that we can use the two-parameter approximation method in [Dushoff 1999 paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580999914284) coupled with the equations above. At the disease free equilibrium, $\kappa$ is going to equal the squared coefficient of variance of the total population: $\hat{\kappa}$. As $S$ approaches 0, $\kappa$ is also going to reach equilibrium (i.e. $\dot{\kappa} = 0$). Using the equation above, we obtain the following equilibrium value: $\kappa^* = \frac{\kappa_3^*}{1 - \kappa_3^*}$, where $\kappa_3^* = \frac{M_3^* M_1^*}{{M_2^*}^2}-1$. Therefore, we can approximate the trajectory of $\kappa$ through the following equation:

$$
\kappa \approx (\hat{\kappa} - \kappa^*)S + \kappa^*
$$
